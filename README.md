# Deep Learning Multi-Model Segragated Dendrites Model (Master's thesis)


See `Spike_Dendrite_Main.ipynb` for an example of loading MNIST, creating a network and training it.

This code requires the [MNIST dataset files](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the code.
